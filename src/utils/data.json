Het budget zo goed mogelijk inzetten voor het beste onderwijs.\r\n\r\n__Uitdagend werk__\r\n-\r\n\r\nWe hebben al heel wat vooronderzoek gedaan. Zo hebben we al een goed systeem om terug te kijken naar onze financiële prestaties in het verleden. Als Product Owner ga jij ons helpen om naar de toekomst te kijken. Met de aankoop, implementatie en (door)ontwikkeling van een state of the art begrotings- en prognosesysteem. Vanuit integraliteit werk je intensief samen met andere collega’s van HR en Management informatie. Voor jou een aantrekkelijke combinatie. Want jij hebt ervaring met het kernonderwerp Finance en je weet wensen van stakeholders te vertalen naar op te leveren verbeterde en gedigitaliseerde bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen. Dat doe je door:\r\n\r\n* Een strategische start: je verzamelt ideeën en zet de koers uit binnen een zelfsturend team dat volgens een agile methode samenwerkt. Je gaat nadenken over de inhoud. Wat willen we bereiken en hoe gaan we de prognose tool gebruiken? Je gaat nadenken over het verleden en dit projecteren op de toekomst. We zijn benieuwd naar jouw ideeën.\r\n* Verbinding: je brengt partijen bij elkaar en weet te overtuigen. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met andere Product Owners, de Programma Manager, betrokken stakeholders (gebruikers van het systeem zoals professionals en directieleden), de scrummaster en specialisten, bijvoorbeeld de technisch specialisten die in het digitale systeem realiseren wat jij met je team hebt bedacht.\r\n* Een wow effect te creëren bij je stakeholders: in de rol van Product Owner ga je waarde toevoegen omdat jij enerzijds een gedegen bedrijfseconomische achtergrond hebt, maar ook omdat je een commerciële instelling hebt en het oprecht leuk vindt om mensen te verbinden. Je gaat met hen aan tafel en maakt ze enthousiast.\r\n\r\n__Juiste match__\r\n-\r\n\r\nJe bent een resultaatgerichte en verbindende Product Owner die goed kan luisteren, analyseren en verkopen. Samen met je stakeholders en Scrum Team ga je voor succes. Door je prettige manier van communiceren zorg je voor transparantie en duidelijkheid van de product backlog en de product roadmap. En dan heb je ook nog:\r\n\r\n* Een hbo-diploma, bijvoorbeeld in de richting van economie of IT. Richting is niet het belangrijkste, je hebt in ieder geval een sterke affiniteit met Finance, ICT en innovatie.\r\n* Minimaal 5 jaar relevante ervaring als bijvoorbeeld Product Owner, Project Manager of Consultant. Door je ervaring weet je een product vision board en roadmap te creëren en weet je hoe je de voortgang bewaakt van backlog items en opleverdata.\r\n* Commercieel gevoel, waardoor je tijdens implementatie kan zorgen voor draagvlak en je hand niet omdraait voor het verzorgen van specifieke trainingen. Ook kan je goed omgaan met andere meningen van belangrijke stakeholders.  \r\n\r\n__Inspirerende omgeving__\r\n-\r\n\r\nAvans Hogeschool heeft 53 hbo-opleidingen, 31.000 studenten en 2.800 medewerkers.
